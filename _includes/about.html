						 I’m a bold and independent thinker who is most comfortable in uncertainty. I challenge myself and others every day. I have always been a hacker. Building, tinkering, and reverse engineering come as second nature. I’m constantly self-improving while maintaining a work ethic that can move mountains and a passion for what I do best: Making it happen.
