I woke up to a dull pain in my upper back. The others woke for other reasons. We packed up, took our showers at the campground facilities, and hit the road stopping immediately for breakfast at McDonald's and to refuel.

*Packing up our Nebraska campsite*

We aimed for Salt Lake City, Utah by the end of the day. Along the way, got to experience the super-flat Nebraska landscape.

One of our stops for gas had this amazing roadside attraction:

The Lasso Espresso had free WiFi. Needless to say, we stayed there for a bit and enjoyed some coffee bevereges. Afterwards we stopped at a nearby Walmart to pick up firewood, ice, and a IcyHot patch for my back which had not relented aching.

Guillermo shopped for campgrounds while we sped along the highway to Wyoming.

Soon after crossing the Wyoming border, we began seeing some wild looking mountains that attracted our attention after several hundred miles of Nebraska's flatlands. Then we drove by this guy:

Soon thereafter our GPS instruted us to "Turn left" and we discovered that our campground was at the base of this mountain! It kept getting better the closer we got to teh campground. The terrein here was wild to us and it begged to be explored. We picked our campsite and set up. A tree had recently been cut down and chopped into firewood nearby. We enjoyed our first campfire and finally used our groceries that we've been hauling since Missouri.

Noticing the clear and stary sky, we paused for a moment to watch the stars. Finially, we stowed away in our tents for an extra chilly night.
