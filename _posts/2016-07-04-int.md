A big part of my learning from this internship has come from discovering how to stay focused and productive for so long. Staying focused was one of the first struggles I noticed early on and it remains a daily struggle to even more than six weeks later.

I have noticed some patterns as well as developed some habits that keep me productive longer and generally more fulfilled at the end of the day.

Instead of spending my lunch break at the desk, I go for a stroll. Aimlessly wandering the city clears my mind and resets any tunnel vision I may have developed working on a problem earlier that day. The light exercise lets me burn off some of that mid-morning caffeine preparing me to set in for the remainder of the day.

I’m a mobile person. I prefer to pace, climb on furniture, sit on the floor, whatever I’m feeling to get the creative juices flowing. I can’t really do that in the office so that mid-day stroll has to last for the whole day.
