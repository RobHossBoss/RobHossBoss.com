After spending a week getting to know Teensy and its audio capabilities, I've settled on a contribution to make to the Teensy project this semester. The goal: to add a reverberation C++ audio object for the Teensy. This may seem like a small contribution, and well... it is. But keep in mind that I'll be doing this alongside a packed schedule of 300 - 400 level college courses. Also, I will only be able to dedicate 2 - 4 hours per week to this project. We are nearing the halfway point of the semester and have just received our Teensy and began development.

### Where to Start

I narrowed my search to a reverb object by first visiting Paul Stoffregen's site and navigating to his wonderful [road-map of the Teensy audio library](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AudioRoadmap.html). Here, the progress of features is laid out alongside popular feature requests. One simple line caught my eye:

 ![Reverb: reverb object needed](../../../../img/reverb_object_needed.png "Reverb object needed")

That simple request caught my eye, because unlike the others which had nearly a paragraph of supporting information and potential starting points, this one line was all that there was.

### Research

The next step was to research digital audio and digital audio effects. I knew that the Teensy deals with WAV files so I started there.

#### WAV

.WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) files are typically uncompressed waveform storing files. The .WAV file stores a series of hexadecimal values that simply determine volume levels.

 ![WAV HEX](../../../../img/wav_hex.jpg "WAV HEX")

These HEX values are collected by sampling the original pure audio waveform at selected intervals. This interval is the bit rate of the audio file. A higher bitrate will be closer to the original wave and thus have higher sound quality at the cost of a larger file size.

 ![square wave](../../../../img/square_wave.jpg "square wave")

Now on to the more complicated bit.

#### Reverb

Reverb is the echoing sound that occurs when a sound is reflected back the listening source from its surroundings. The main component of a digital reverb effect is the continuous echo. Although there are other variables that shape the sound of the reverb.

I'll be focusing primarily on the main component of a reverb: echoes.

![reverb](../../../../img/reverb.jpg "reverb")

Reverb is altered by adjusting the number of echoes, the distance of each echo from the listener, the magnitude of each echo and more. This is beginning to seem preaty mathematically intensive for the Teensy.

Let's go back to basics. Echo.

The echo effect is obtained by creating a buffer sound wave to play alongside the default wave. This buffered wave will be a duplicate of the default wave with a basic delay applied to all samples.


<pre>
  <code class="language-cpp">
  int delayMilliseconds = 500; // half a second
  int delaySamples =
      (int)((float)delayMilliseconds * 44.1f); // assumes 44100 Hz sample rate
  float decay = 0.5f;
  for (int i = 0; i < buffer.length - delaySamples; i++)
  {
      // WARNING: overflow potential
      buffer[i + delaySamples] += (short)((float)buffer[i] * decay);
  }
  </code>
</pre>

The Teensy Project already has a simple delay object that I can use as a starting point.

The challenge is going to be assembling multiple delays with different parameters and adding extra effects to achieve a true reverb.

That's all for now. Next step is to experiment with the Teensy a bit more and try to find a way to apply multiple echoes.
