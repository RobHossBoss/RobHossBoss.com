At approximately 8 o'clock my Impalla set course to Nashville to pick up Guillermo, Nina, and Jose at Nina's home. I arrived at about 2:30 to a meal prepared by Nina's mother. After the meal, we began to pack the Impalla; worried after seeing Nina's two large luggage bags by the door. We got the lot in the car by filling up the back left seat with two guitars and all the odds and ends.

It was about then that it began to rain. We finished packing and cramed into the car that would be our home base for the next five days. Immediately, we took the wrong highway ramp and traved 20 minutes in the wrong direction before turning around. "Great start!", we thought to ourselves. Once we affirmed that we were actually getting CLOSER to Portland, the dread and meloncoly of leaving home began to give way to excitement.

We passed the time with an assortment of games until we stopped for refuling at a tourist shop in Western Kentucky. Shortly thereafter, I suggested that we visit a small region in Southeast Missouri with wich I was very familiar. We set a new course for Fredricktown Missouri and planned to stay in the Marble Creek Campground aff HWY E. On the way we crossed the Mississippi River. We had dinner at the Pizza Hut in Fredricktown and stocked up on groceries at the local Wal-Mart.

We arrived to the campground well after dark and set up our tents. Jose and I struggled to get a fire started with the damp twigs while Guillerm oand Nina set up our tents using the car's headlights to see. No fire tonight. 

I had dreams of waking up to a crackeling campfire. I awoke to a damp pillow and cool air.
