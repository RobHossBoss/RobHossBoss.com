I used to be known as the guy who always has everything he needs. That hasn't changed, I just "need" way, way less.

I grew up in a home where the kitchen table overflowed with shoe boxes of old photos. The living room was packed with suitcases, hunting rifles, taxidermy deer, zebra, bear, fish, etc. My room was stuffed with toys from my childhood. The idea of a mess, of things, was always present.

I'm still not completely sure yet what led me to want to live this way. I went back to my home for spring break where I returned to that familiar mess after a year away at college. I guess I had enough.

One trip to the local dump and one trip to the local donation center later and 40% of my "non-belongings" were gone. It was a start. I think my parents saw that too.

Back to my dorm where I brought equally as many things to clutter my life when I moved in last year. I've packed up the things that are not bringing value and they too are on their way to a donation center.

I'm getting ready to move again for the summer. This time I have a visual list of things I need. Nothing else shall remain.

### Here are the 100-ish things I own:

This list is a living collection. Updated as new things enter/exit my life.


It's not about the things. It's about the benefits. For me, the more I limit what I own, the more I expand my quality of life.

### The Things I Don't:

While limiting my physical clutter, I've also taken steps to reduce my digital/social clutter. I've removed all social media apps, as well as disabled email notifications on my phone. I've nearly stopped using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Mainly because I've transitioned to Github and Reddit. I've cut the hours I spend watching YouTube, listening to music, and completely unsubscribed from Netflix.

The benefits have begun to show themselves. For me, it means being more informed. I fill my free time reading up on current events, taking the time to read a book, or just relaxing and reflecting in quiet solace.

I've found more time to write. When I work, I get more done. When I engage in conversation, I'm more present in the moment. I'm sleeping better. I'm looking forward to dropping off that last load of stuff at the Goodwill. It's liberating.  

If I've forgotten anything that you've found to be extremely valuable in your life, let me know. I'd be glad to consider it for inclusion in this list.

I'm new to minimalism and tips are much appreciated.
