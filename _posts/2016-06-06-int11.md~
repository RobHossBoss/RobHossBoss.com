I’m starting my 3rd week working as an intern at [Punchmark](www.punchmark.com). I’ve developed some opinions and reactions about how I feel about the experience so far. First, allow me to take you through my work day.

* 07:00 - Alarm goes off.
* 07:30ish - Get out of bed and shower.
* 07:45ish - Dress, groom, breakfast, YouTube, blog.
* 08:30 - Leave appartment
* 08:50ish - Arrive at work. Make coffee. Stretch.
* 09:00 - Eyes on screen. Coffee on desk. Bathroom break.
* 13:00 - Lunch. Reddit.
* 14:00 - Eyes on screen. Water on desk. Bathroom break.
* 18:00 - Leave work.
* 18:40 - Arrive at apartment. Free time.

I guess my reason for taking you through an accurate representation of a weekday, is to say that I spend the majority of my day ass plastered on chair and eyes glued to screen. The glamour of “the internship” vanishes quickly once you realise you have a 9-5 job just like all the drones of society you vowed you’d never become.

I’m learning that it takes variety in my work to keep me alive. Working for hours on a single project or weeks in the same chair doing about the same thing is not where I belong. Granted, this is what I signed up for. This is what “Full-Time Web Developer” means. I cannot complain. I can only note that I’ve learned something through this internship. Something valuable. Something that would have been a pain to learn after accepting a 3-year contract to another organization.

I still love what I’m doing at work. The first 3 hours each day are my most productive. Mondays are especially productive. It’s the dose that makes the poison. For me, that dose is a 40-hour work week of “Eyes on screen. Beverage on desk. Bathroom break”.
