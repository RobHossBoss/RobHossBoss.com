This internship represented a lot of firsts for me. It was my first time living in an apartment. First time living in a city. First 40hr/week job. First non-minimum wage job. Those are the big ones. Before this internship, I was curious how I would react to these environments. 

I'm glad to say that I've learned a lot. I learned that I love the city and never want to leave. I learned that I dread 40hr workweeks. That I should find something I'm really passionate about and work for myself. I learned what a $15/hr paycheck can buy and what it can't. 

I still have lots of questions. I wonder what a more interactive and involved work environment would feel like. In my experience with Google, I got to see how their employees self-organizes and work collaboratively. I was enamored by their work style and I am eager to try a job with similar values and structure. 

I also want to have experience being my own boss. I would like to start something myself and run it. It's one of those things that I think I will love to do but I want to know for sure.
