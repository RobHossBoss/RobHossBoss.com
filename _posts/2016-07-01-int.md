Some employers think they are getting an excellent candidate only to discover that candidate's greatest skill is self-promotion.

Sometimes I feel that this is the case in my recent employment. I am amazed everyday at the amount of stuff I do not know. I often feel like a kid who just shows up everyday and secretly works here.

After a bit of casual research, I discovered that I might be suffering from imposter syndrome. Although a mild case for sure, I still find myself thinking “Do I deserve this?” with every paycheck and unproductive day. 

It’s important to realize that nobody belongs here more than me. I submitted, followed up, interviewed, and did all the work needed to get here. I need to remind myself that when I hold back I’m robbing the world of my potential. If I focus on providing value instead of sitting and writing code, that paycheck will seem well earned.
