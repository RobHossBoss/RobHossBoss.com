I just want to preface this with something. I finished this entire post then overwote it, accidentially, in VIM. Yay! So if this one seems brief or lackluster, that's because it's late, I'm annoyed. So yeah.

The internship is nearing its end. Let's talk about what's changed with me.

I no longer feel like I need to practice developing professionalism or career development. I'm doing pretty good in that department and I feel like I've devoted the better part of two years to that and enough is enough.

I've seen the importance of doing somehting that you enjoy. I also have realized that most of what I know about my field is web development and design. I'm making a point to explore my field a bit more just to be sure I'm not missing anything super fun.

Pilimenary reading: I know what I want to be-- a CEO. 

It amazed me all the roles and skills that the owners of Punchmark had to fill. Granted there are three of them to divi up the work. But take Ross for instance. Every day he takes calls, sells procts and services, markets the company, plans future events, brainstorms ideas. All the while, he writes code and designs. He's a marketer. He's a brand ambasador. He's a developer. He's a designer. He's a CEO. And he's never bored.
