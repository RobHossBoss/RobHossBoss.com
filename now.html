 A young man asked a old wise man, "I have so many interests. How do I prioritize? What skills should I pursue?"
 The old man told him to make a list of 20 of his favorite interests. Then to circle 5 of them and come back to him. The young man did so, and came back to the old man the next day. "What have you learned?", the old man asked. "I see now", siad the yong man, "that I should focus on the 5 circled interests and then do the others if I have time." "No", the old man replied, "you have it all wrong. You should focus on those five and avoid the others at all cost."
 </p>

 <p> With that tale in mind, I present my "Now" list:
 These are the things I am focusing on right now. It dosent mean I can't do other things too. Just know that I am devoting 90% of my time and effort to the tings on this list.
